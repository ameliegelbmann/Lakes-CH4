# Lakes-CH4
Data analysis of CH4 drivers (biological, physical, chemical) in lakes
The "N2,Kd,Ch4..."(physical data), "Profiles_CTD..."(chemical data) and "Fluoro_plots_plank..." (biological data, cf species) scripts are used to create lakes profiles for 3 different periods (June 2018, September 2018 and June 2019). See image Rplot122 for a result exemple.
The purpose of the "Loop_Linear_Reg" script is to create linear regression of the different parameters in each lakes at each periods of time. Two plots have been created: one with the average of the data point and the other with the raw data point. See image Rplot148 for a result exemple.
